# some of my terrible code
### downloadOptifine.py
Downloads and install optifine on chosen MultiMC instance,
needs to be ran in the instances folder.  
Needs BeautifulSoup4 to run ( `pip install beautifulsoup4` )

#### downloadOptifineGui.pyw
same as above except it has a gui made in wx and you can put the script anywhere

### matboard.pyw
nohboard copy but its made on pygame and uses [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) to get the key presses, to make your own layout just edit the keys array (line 29)

### IsMyInternetWorking.py

### dither.py
